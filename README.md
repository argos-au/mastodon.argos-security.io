### [Server rules](https://mastodon.argos-security.io/about/more#rules)

Below is a summary of rules you need to follow if you want to have an account on this server of Mastodon:

1. Do unto others as you think they would want done to them.
1. Mark sensitive content with a content warning.
1. Gratuitously obscene that serves no practical benefit to a discussion is not permitted.
1. Illegal content such as child pornography, unsurprisingly, is not permitted
1. Lack of a specific rule against a certain behavior does not indicate acceptance of that behavior. Each of us has a limited amount of time in this world. Don't be a jerk.
1. Hate speech and abusive or threatening behavior is not permitted, specifically that which directed at any gender, nationality, religion, race, age, pizza topping preference, or sexual identity. One can hate on systemd all day long here.
1. Violating one or more of these rules may result in an immediate, permanent ban without notice or warning.
1. Spam is not permitted, this includes creating spam accounts that only serve to provide profile links or advertise products and services.
1. You may not impersonate a person or brand without a clear indication the account is unofficial and/or a parody. Parody accounts are permitted, as are legitimate brand accounts.
